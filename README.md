# Shifu-Page
Everyone its artisans, on premise

Welcome to Shifu Page!

Shifu Page is a small software on premise to let anyone share its favorit artisan contacts.   

The installation of Shifu Page is quite straightforward: just copy all the files of this repository to your website to have your page.    

Indeed, there are a couple of things you need customize by yourself:   
<ul>
<li>Add foto*.jpg as your artisan pictures.</li>
<li>In index.xml you need to:</li>
<ol>   
<li>find out all the foto.jpg instances and replace each with the artisan foto you require.</li>
<li>find out "http://typeme.in/l/wochapp" and replace it with your artisan contact.</li>
<ol>   
</ul>
